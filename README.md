# Soil Moisture Meter

### Purpose
The Soil Moisture Meter is a product that is intended to obtain the soil moisture of a homeowner's lawn, and then predict how frequently the lawn should be watered. The soil moisture is measured with a network of soil moisture sensors, and the data is sent by radios to a "home hub". The homehub processes the data, before displaying it on it's LCD screen. A Bluetooth app can also connect to the Arduino, where further data can be stored and analyzed. 

### Design
The Soil Moisture Meter's home hub is shown below. It has a LCD screen, as well as buttons for user interaction.
